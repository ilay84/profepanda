Exercise Type: Dictation (dictation)

Design (inside .ppx-modal body)
- Container: `.ppx-ex ppx-ex--dictation` using shared exercise CSS.
- Header: brief instructions; show item-level counter via fraction in progress.
- Media: prominent audio control above the input; reuse media toggle only when extra visuals are present. Audio control that let's user adjust speed preferred.
- Work area: single large text input (single line or textarea by option) with word/char count. Accent + Special character insert buttons: á é í ó ú ö ü ¿ ¡
- Controls: `Check` button below input; inline feedback beneath; hint toggle + panel; footer with dots + prev/next pods.

Flow
- User plays audio (optionally auto-play on item load) and types transcription.
- `Check` remains disabled until min characters or at least 1 token typed (configurable).
- On check: evaluate against reference transcript (normalize by options: case, punctuation, whitespace, accent marks).
- If `allowRetry` is enabled, show differences and allow another attempt; else lock and proceed.
- Optional: limit attempts per item; on final attempt, reveal full correct transcript.

Feedback
- Inline message: overall correct/incorrect; display token-level diff highlighting: (red for all incorrect characters, red underscore _ for missing characters)
  - Correct tokens: green; wrong/missing: red; extra tokens: dimmed with strikethrough.
- Optionally show per-rule hints (e.g., “Mind capitalization of proper nouns”).
- aria-live polite announcement of result summary.

Summary Page
- Card with score badge and overall stats (correct items / total; hints used).
- For each item (accordion):
  - Audio player: audio player to replay audio from that slide (item).
  - Header: first 6–8 words of transcript + Correcto/Incorrecto chip.
  - Panel: “Your answer” text block with diff colors; “Correct answer” block; audio replay control.
- Restart button at bottom.

Admin Builder
- Item fields: `audio_url` (or upload), `transcript` (neutral, used across site languages), optional accepted variants (one per line).
- Options: `ignoreCase`, `ignorePunctuation`, `normalizeWhitespace`, `ignoreAccents`, `minCharsToEnableCheck`, `allowRetry`, `attemptsMax`, `autoPlay`.
- Hint fields: `hint_es/en`; optional per-item feedback blocks.
- Media: same upload/URL accordion; allow an optional image to provide context.
